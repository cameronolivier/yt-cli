# Task 0005: Update README.md

## Description

The `README.md` file is outdated and does not reflect the current command-line interface and options of the `yt-cli` tool. This task is to update the documentation to be accurate and helpful for users.

## Plan

1.  **Review Current State:**
    - Read the content of the current `README.md` file.
    - Read the content of `src/index.ts` to get the definitive list of commands, options, and their descriptions.

2.  **Identify Discrepancies:**
    - Compare the options and usage examples in `README.md` with the implementation in `src/index.ts`.
    - Pay special attention to the recently changed `--transcript` flag.

3.  **Update Documentation:**
    - Update the "Options" section in `README.md` to match the available flags and their behavior.
    - Add a detailed explanation for the `--transcript` flag, similar to the one added to the `--help` output.
    - Review and update the "Usage" section with accurate and relevant examples.
    - Ensure all options are documented correctly.

4.  **Verification:**
    - Reread the updated `README.md` to ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
